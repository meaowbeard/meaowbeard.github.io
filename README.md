## How This Blog Works

This blog is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on GitHub Pages. It uses the [Chirpy theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/) to keep things simple and clean.

If you'd like to see how it's all put together or even contribute ideas, feel free to check out the code in this repository.
