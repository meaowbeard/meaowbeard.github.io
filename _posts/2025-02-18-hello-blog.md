Hello! Welcome to my blog! I made this blog as a personal outlet - an honest and ever-evolving record of my daily life.
I didn't create this blog with some grand expectations, I just wanted a neat space where I can share some of my thoughts,
ideas and maybe a bit of everyday rambling.

Since Minecraft has always been one of my favourite games and is also something very special for me, I wanted my very first
blog post to be Minecraft related. Minecraft is a creative outlet that has helped me through some of my toughest times.

### **1. Setting Realistic Expectations**
When first starting out, remember that progress happens one step at a time. Here are some tips to keep your goals achievable and motivating:
- Start Small:
  <p>
    Instead of attempting an epic remake of Elden Ring or Zelda in Minecraft, begin with something more manageable.
    This will help you refine your skills on smaller projects, without leaving you feeling overwhelmed.
  </p>
- Focus on your own growth:
  <p>
    Do not compare your builds to those of others. Rather than saying, "My build looks worse than that one",
    try "My build is an improvement over what I did last time." Every small step is a step forward to building your dream Minecraft base!
  </p>


> ##### Enjoy the process!
Building should be fun and a way to express yourself, not a race or competition.
Allow yourself the time to experiment, learn and improve your skills without self-judgement.

### **2. The Block Palette**
Everything in Minecraft is made of blocks - so choosing the right one is like selecting
colors for your painting. A carefully chosen block palette can transform an okay build to
something amazing, while clashing colors can disrupt the whole look. There is a lot of information
on colour theory on the Internet, but I'll keep it simple.

Over time, I've discovered a couple of online tools that helped me experiment and refine
my block choices - especially when my creativity is dwindling down. Just to be clear, I'm not
affiliated with these sites - they've simply been useful resources for me.

- [HueBlocks](https://1280px.github.io/hueblocks/) is a fantastic tool for creating smooth gradients - a technique
that's become a favourite in many of my builds. I can't even remember a recent build where I didn't incorporate
a gradient in some way.
- [Block Palettes](https://www.blockpalettes.com/) offers a variety of "preset" block palette combinations. Although this is a fantastic website, I often prefer to
create my own palettes because the presets on that website rarely capture the vision I have for the build I'm working on.

> ##### Experiment!
Experiment with these tools, don't be afraid to try your own ideas and develop your own style! Feel stuck?
Look up some inspirational images on websites like Pinterest! The right block palette can make all the difference a build.

### **3. The Shape of your Build**

Before you start building that massive castle you have planned, here's a tip - sketch out a basic layout.
I usually start by marking where I want my walls and key features to be. The initial sketch doesn't even have to be in-game!
Even a simple pen-and-paper sketch can do the job. I prefer to use coloured wool to sketch out my layouts.
Try not to overcomplicate things, unless you really love the challenge - after all, not everyone is a fan of
100 diagonal windows (though there are always exceptions...)

> ##### Be careful!
Do not overcomplicate your basic layout!

### **4. Add Depth**
![Example of a flat wall](https://i.imgur.com/BYRI5JL.jpg){: width="400" .w-50 .right}

The easiest way to improve your build right now is to add depth. Instead of making your walls flat,
try indenting certain sections to create a sense of 3D depth. Another example is swapping full
glass blocks for glass panes - this can add further details to your walls.

> ##### Tip
Even subtle changes in a build can make a big difference in how your build looks.
Experiment with different levels of indentations to find what suits you best. Don't go overboard though!

### **5. Iterate**

![Example of an iteration](https://i.imgur.com/oAWJDSN.jpg){: width="450" .w-50 .right}

Don't be afraid to change up things as you're building. Sometimes the first version won't be perfect, or
it's no longer matching your original vision. If something doesn't work - figure out why it doesn't work and rebuild it.

Over time, each iteration of your build will bring you closer to your ideal design.

> ##### Tip
It's completely normal to start over or rework parts of your build. Each "restart" is a chance to improve your skills!

### **6. Add Vegetation**

Adding vegetation is a very simple way to breathe life into your build. A few well-placed bushes, patches of grass
or a rose bush can transform your barren-looking build into something more vibrant. Experiment with different types
of plants to find the perfect balance that compliments your build.

![Example of an iteration](https://i.imgur.com/WjRTOdX.jpg)

> ##### Tip
Think of vegetation as the final flourish. Small touches of greenery can add color, texture or even depth to your build and bring a sense
of a world that's lived in. This works for even the most basic builds!

### **6. Overhanged Roofs**
Flat roofs can make a build look unfinished. Experiment with different roof shapes and overhangs.
Overhangs will make your build look more realistic, especially for more medieval types of builds.
If you're building something fantasy-inspired, consider adding grass or flowers on top to create
a more lush build!

### **7. Paths**
Just like adding vegetation breathes life into your build, a well designed pathway can make your
house feel like a part of the world, rather than just a structure sitting in it. Instead of using
a single block type, like the dirt path block, try mixing materials like cobblestone, coarse dirt,
gravel or moss for a more natural look. You can even add buttons (as little stones) for a more
organic and lived-in look!

### **8. Trees! (Bonus points for Custom Trees!)**
Trees will single-handedly transform your build, making it feel more immersive and natural. While
Minecraft's default trees can sometimes work fine, custom trees can bring your build to the next level.

Building Custom Trees is actually easier than it might seem! Start with a base and build upwards. You can use fences,
slabs or trap doors for branches, and start layering the leaves. One crucial detail a lot of people seem to
miss is **leaving gaps between the leaves** - real trees don't completely block out the sun! Adding small
pockets of air will make your trees look more natural and realistic.

> ##### Tip
Real trees aren't perfect - they twist and grow into all sorts of directions. Looking at photos of
real trees can help you create more natural looking trees!

### **9. Look for Inspiration & Keep Practicing**
Even the **BEST** builders started somewhere! Look up at reference images from real
places, other builders or even concept art ideas. Experiment, practice and don't get
discouraged if a build doesn't turn out how you imagined it.

> ##### Tip
Save screenshots of your older builds so you can look back and see how much you've
improved over time.
