Over the last couple of weeks, I had the urge to bake a cake. After browsing through a few recipes, I finally settled on one: The Minecraft Cake!
Of course, following the exact Minecraft recipe isn't very practical, as it calls for three buckets of milk and wheat (and I have no idea how to turn wheat into flour!)

This project turned out to be more challenging than I had anticipated. I didn't even have a square pan! I spent 2 weeks searching for one in my town, but none were available.
In the end, I ordered one online and it arrived! Now, it's time to get cooking!

### The Cake Base
For my cake, I opted for a classic vanilla sponge version.

> I used 8 eggs, which is quite a lot! I was aiming for a really large cake with extra fluffy layers, but in the end, it didn’t expand as much as I hoped.
If you want a smaller cake, you can easily cut the recipe in half and use 4 eggs instead.
{: .prompt-warning }

#### Ingredients
The ingredients I used for the cake are the following:
- 8 Eggs
- 1 teaspoon of vinegar
- 240 grams of powdered sugar
- 240 grams of all-purpose flour
- 1 / 2 teaspoon of salt
- 10 grams of baking powder
- 30 grams of oil
- 30 grams of butter
- 80 grams of milk
- A splash of vanilla essence

> ##### Preheat your oven!
Before you start mixing, preheat your oven to 180 °C (356 °F). If your oven runs "hotter", you may want to bake at 150 °C (302 °F) instead to prevent overbaking.
{: .prompt-tip }

#### The Liquid Ingredients
To achieve maximum "airiness" for my sponge cake, I separated the eggs yolks and whipped the egg whites with a teaspoon of vinegar. The vinegar helps stabilize the egg whites,
making them extra foamy and fluffy. Then, I gradually added the powdered sugar while continuing to whip until I reached stiff peaks. Be careful not to overmix!

Once the whites were ready, I gently folded in the yolks by hand with a whisk to maintain as much volume as possible.

In a separate bowl, I combined 30 grams of oil, 30 grams of butter, 80 grams of milk and a splash of vanilla essence until everything was
well mixed. The butter should be melted before mixing. You can microwave it for about 10-15 seconds until it’s liquid but not too hot. For now I put this mixture aside.

#### The Dry Ingredients
Mixing the dry ingredients is straightforward. I simply sifted the flour and baking powder together to eliminate any lumps and added a pinch of salt to enhance the flavor.

#### Combing the Ingredients
Next, I gently poured the sifted dry ingredients into the egg mixture and used a hand whisk to fold them until just combined. After that, I added
the oil, butter, milk and vanilla essence, whisking until you have a homogenous batter.

> ##### Do not to overmix! Be careful!
The goal is a light, fluffy and airy cake.
Overmixing can release too much gluten from the flour, which may result in a desner, chewier texture - the opposite of what a sponge cake should be!
{: .prompt-warning }

#### Baking
Now it's time for baking! I lined the bottom of my cake pan with a baking sheet to make it easier to remove the cake later, then carefully poured in the batter.
Bake for about 35 minutes at 180 °C (356 °F), or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. If your oven runs hotter, you may need to reduce the
temperature to 150°C (302°F) for better results.

### The Frosting
#### Ingredients
- 220 grams of butter (softened, but not liquid!)
- 150 grams of powdered sugar
- 160 grams of cream cheese
- 160 grams of mascarpone
- 1 tsp of vanilla extract (optional)
- A splash of milk (only if needed, to adjust consistence)

> If you don't have creamy cottage cheese, you can replace it for mascaropone or cream cheese - both of them can add richness to the frosting and a slight tangy flavour!
{: .prompt-info }

#### Instructions
1. Beat the softened butter with a hand mixer until smooth and fluffy.
2. Gradually add the powdered sugar, mixing well.
3. Add the cream cheese and mascarpone, mixing well until fully combined and smooth.
5. If the frosting is too thick, add a small splash of milk to adjust the texture.

Feel free to modify the frosting as you like, just make sure it's not too runny!

### Assembling the Cake
1. Layering the cake & applying the frosting
- If your cake batter turns out to be too much for your pan, you might need to bake it in 2 batches.
- If you end up with 2 cake layers, spread a thin layer of frosting between them before stacking
- If you baked a single thick cake, you can cut it into two layers.
2. Applying the frosting
- Start with a spoon to scoop the frosting onto the top and sides of the cake.
- Use an offset spatula (or a knife) to gently spread and smooth the frosting.
- It might not be perfectly smooth, but that's totally fine!

### The Red Squares
#### Ingredients
- Raspberry Jam (home made or store-bought, preferably without seeds)
- 1 tbsp of lemon juice
- 1-2 tbsp of Gelatin Powder
- 3 tbsp of warm water (to disolve the gelatin)

#### Instructions
1. In a small bowl, mix the raspberry jam with lemon juice until smooth.
2. Disolve the gelatin powder in the warm water and let it bloom for about 5 minutes.
3. Gently heat the gelatin mixture until the gelatin disolves. I usually just microwave it for like 10 seconds.
4. Stir the disollved gelatin into the jam mixture until well combined.
5. Pour the mixture into a small, flat container or parchment-lined pan to create an even layer.
6. Place it in the fridge for about an hour or until it's fully set.
7. Once firm, use a sharp knife to cut out the small squares, just like the Minecraft cake.
8. Carefully place the squares on top of your frosted cake!

> **Pro tip:** if the squares feel too soft while cuytting, try putting them in the freezer for about 10 minutes and try again.

I slightly messed up one of the red squares in the middle, but that's okay.

# Final Thoughts
Thank you for reading my blog post! I hope you enjoyed following along with my baking experiment. If you decide to make the
Minecraft cake for yourself - good luck! I think it turned out pretty nicely. I had a blast making it for family and some friends and seeing their
reactions made it all worthwhile.

Stay safe and keep baking!
